## EDA CASE STUDY


### Banking Risk Analytics EDA Case Study

This project involved analyzing customer data to identify patterns in loan defaults. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), I investigated key variables that influence whether a customer is likely to default on a loan. Insights gained from this analysis help banks assess risk and make informed decisions in lending. Key skills demonstrated include data cleaning, feature selection, statistical analysis, and visualization to detect trends related to defaulters.

## Lead Scoring Case Study

In this project, I developed a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of leads converting into customers for an EdTech company. After performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors influencing lead conversion, I built a scoring system to prioritize leads based on their conversion potential. The model helped optimize sales efforts and improve marketing efficiency. Key skills demonstrated include data preprocessing, feature engineering, logistic regression, and model evaluation.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
